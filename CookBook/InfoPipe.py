'''
---note 1 ---walk
Generate the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. For each directory in the tree rooted at directory top (including top itself), it yields a 3-tuple (dirpath, dirnames, filenames).

---note 2 ---fnmatch
This module provides support for Unix shell-style wildcards, which are not the same as regular expressions (which are documented in the re module). The special characters used in shell-style wildcards are:

*	matches everything
?	matches any single character
[seq]	matches any character in seq
[!seq]	matches any character not in seq

'''

    Find all filenames in a directory tree that match a shell wildcard pattern

def gen_opener(filenames): '''
Open a sequence of filenames one at a time producing a file object. The file is closed immediately when proceeding to the next iteration. '''

Chain a sequence of iterators together into a single sequence. '''

Look for a regex pattern in a sequence of lines '''
